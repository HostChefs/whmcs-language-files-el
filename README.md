### WHMCS Language File - Greek (el)

In continue of all previous posts about Greek Language Files, we would like to inform you that we have completed the translation of the latest WHMCS client area into Greek (el) for everyone that needs it.

For instructions on overrides, please visit: http://docs.whmcs.com/Language_Overrides

**Notes:**

- This language file is been translated by the contributor and therefore it will not be updated by WHMCS Limited in future updates.
- We recommend that you use overrides to customize the text displayed in a way which will be safely preserved through the upgrade process.
- If you would like to suggest or report a fault, please make a pull request
